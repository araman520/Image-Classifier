#Image-Classifier

## Installation

This project does not require any libraries outside Anaconda. Python 3 was used for this project.

## Project Motivation

We classify 102 different categories of flower images. The image data can be found here - https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/flower_data.tar.gz

## File Descriptions

1. Image Classifier.ipynb - The Jupyter notebook has all the code and the explanation of the flow necessary for this project
2. Image Classifier.html - The HTML file is the same Jupyter notebook in HTML format
3. cat_to_name.json - Category number to flower name

## Interacting with this project

Running the Jupyter notebook after downloading the flower data in the right folder is the way to interact with the project

## Results

We used PyTorch's pretrained vgg11, and trained our own classifier. The testing accuracy was 0.773
